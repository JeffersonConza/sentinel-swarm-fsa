A comprehensive implementation of the Fish Swarm Algorithm (FSA) for optimization problems, developed as part of a hackathon project. This repository demonstrates the application of bio-inspired swarm intelligence for solving complex optimization challenges.

## üêü What is Fish Swarm Algorithm?

The Fish Swarm Algorithm (FSA) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm that mimics the collective behavior of fish schools in their natural habitat. Developed by Li et al. in 2002, FSA simulates the way fish move, forage, and interact with each other to find optimal solutions in complex search spaces.

### Key Principles

Fish in nature exhibit several intelligent behaviors that form the foundation of FSA:

1. **Foraging Behavior**: Fish actively search for food sources (optimal solutions)
2. **Schooling Behavior**: Fish tend to move toward areas with higher food density
3. **Following Behavior**: Fish follow other successful fish to promising areas
4. **Random Behavior**: Fish occasionally move randomly to explore new areas

## üî¨ Algorithm Overview

The Fish Swarm Algorithm operates through four main behavioral patterns:

### 1. Prey Behavior (Foraging)
Fish search for food in their local neighborhood. If a better position is found, the fish moves toward it.

### 2. Swarm Behavior (Schooling)
Fish move toward the center of their neighborhood if the food density there is higher than their current position.

### 3. Follow Behavior
Fish follow other fish that have found better positions, simulating the natural tendency to follow successful individuals.

### 4. Random Behavior
When no improvement is found through the above behaviors, fish move randomly to explore new areas and avoid local optima.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-dimensional optimization**: Handles complex, multi-dimensional optimization problems
- **Adaptive parameters**: Dynamic adjustment of algorithm parameters during execution
- **Parallel processing**: Support for concurrent evaluation of multiple fish positions
- **Customizable behaviors**: Configurable behavioral weights and parameters
- **Real-time visualization**: Optional visualization of the optimization process
- **Multiple benchmark functions**: Includes standard test functions for algorithm validation

## üìä Algorithm Flow

```
1. Initialize fish population randomly in search space
2. Evaluate fitness of each fish position
3. For each fish:
   a. Try prey behavior (local search)
   b. Try swarm behavior (move toward school center)
   c. Try follow behavior (follow best neighbor)
   d. If no improvement, perform random movement
4. Update global best position
5. Check termination criteria
6. Repeat from step 3 until convergence or max iterations
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonConza/sentinel-swarm-fsa.git
cd sentinel-swarm-fsa

# Install dependencies (when implementation is added)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üíª Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from fsa import FishSwarmAlgorithm
import numpy as np

# Define objective function (example: sphere function)
def sphere_function(x):
    return np.sum(x**2)

# Initialize FSA
fsa = FishSwarmAlgorithm(
    objective_function=sphere_function,
    dimensions=10,
    population_size=50,
    max_iterations=1000,
    search_bounds=(-10, 10)
)

# Run optimization
best_position, best_fitness = fsa.optimize()
print(f"Best solution: {best_position}")
print(f"Best fitness: {best_fitness}")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
# Custom FSA parameters
fsa_config = {
    'visual_distance': 1.0,      # Visual range for neighbor detection
    'crowd_factor': 0.618,       # Crowding factor for swarm behavior
    'step_length': 0.1,          # Maximum step length
    'try_number': 5,             # Number of attempts for each behavior
    'prey_weight': 0.4,          # Weight for prey behavior
    'swarm_weight': 0.3,         # Weight for swarm behavior
    'follow_weight': 0.2,        # Weight for follow behavior
    'random_weight': 0.1         # Weight for random behavior
}

fsa = FishSwarmAlgorithm(**fsa_config)
```
